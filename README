sysbackup.sh - is a simple Bash backup script with embedded configuration. It
uses 'tar' for file system backup and 'mysqldump' for MySQL databases backup.
It is not mature enough, but I published it in hope that is could be used as a
basis for one's backup script.

Currently, it supports:
 - local and remote (over SSH) backup;
 - GPG encryption;
 - gzip, bzip2, xz compression types;
 - E-mail notifications;

To use it you have to create directories 'system' and 'mysql' in BACKUP_DIR.
The configuration is embedded in the script, so just edit it. The
configuration is self explanatory.

For remote backup you have to generate SSH keys for root user and import
public key on remote machine in REMOTE_USER home directory.

For GPG encryption you have to import a public GPG key of a user (GPG_RCPT)
dedicated for backup decryption operations.

For email notifications, please install mail/mailx utility, if it is not
installed by default in your distro.
