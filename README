sysbackup.sh - is a simple Bash backup script with embedded configuration. It
uses 'tar' for filesystem backup and 'mysqldump' for MySQL databases backup.
It is not mature enough, but I published it in hope that is could be used as a
basis for one's own backup script.

Currently, it supports:
 - local and remote (over SSH) backup;
 - GPG encryption;
 - gzip, bzip2, xz compression types;
 - E-mail notifications;
 - Date format specification

To use it you have to create directories 'system' and 'mysql' in BACKUP_DIR.
The configuration is embedded in the script, so just edit it. The
configuration is self explanatory.

For remote backup you have to generate SSH keys for root user and import the
generated public key on remote machine in REMOTE_USER home directory.

For GPG encryption you have to import a public GPG key of a user (GPG_RCPT)
dedicated for backup decryption operations.

For email notifications, please install mail/mailx utility, if it is not
installed by default in your distro.


Invocation:

./sysbackup.sh [--type=system|mysql] [--notify=yes|no] [--dateformat=weekday|monthday|month]

where:

--type - backup type, 'system' (default) or 'mysql'
--notify - send email notification ('yes') or don't send ('no', default)
--dateformat - date format used to construct filename:
    weekday - day of week (Monday, Tuesday, ...);
    monthday - day of month (1, 5, 28, ...), default;
    month - month name (January, December, ...)

Allow the arguments are optional, for defaults see invocation.


Example:

Create file system backup and optionally send e-mail notification:
./sysbackup.sh --notify=yes

Create MySQL backup and optionally send e-mail notification:
./sysbackup.sh --type=mysql --notify=yes --dateformat=weekday


By default, system backup uses following file name format:
sysbackup-[dateformat].tar.[compression-dependant extension]

and for MySQL backup the format is:
[database_name]-[dateformat].sql.[compression-dependant extension]

For example, 'sysbackup-3.tar.gz' for gzip-compressed system backup, 
initiated on 3rd day of month, and 'mydb-Friday.sql.gpg' for GPG encrypted
MySQL database with name 'mydb' created on Friday.


The default naming format permits simple backup rotation without external
rotation software involvement.

For example, you can setup cron using following method:

0 2 3,10,17,24	* * root /path/to/sysbackup.sh --notify=yes >/dev/null 2>&1
0 3 *		* * root /path/to/sysbackup.sh --type=mysql \
				--dateformat=weekday >/dev/null 2>&1

where system backup will be created each week, four times per month,
automatically overwriting the oldest one. And MySQL backup will be created
every day, overwriting an archive with more than one week age. At any time
you will have four lastest system backups and seven lastest database backups.
